# A bookshelf

##### TO-DO NEXT
- fuck should i just redo all the shelves with flex or is it worth the facility of having the shelf underlines in their proper, exact places?

##### TO-DO LATER
- figure out why the books will go like 6px into the right padding
- add max- and min-width to books
- add .read and .notRead classes to style differently somehow
- shorten author and title names by abbreviating probably
- handle long titles/authors
- by default, organize by author?
- start with x(3?) shelves then add more as needed
- sort them different ways
- add genres?
- how to make things draggable?  not necessary but interesting question

###### DONE
- currently, smaller books will fill in gaps left by big books on earlier rows; decide if I want it this way - could be good, or maybe not if I want to keep authors together.  in fact could make filtering harder in general if they're not in a specific order
- reflow books on shelves upon window resize
- make book card width correspond to page count
- learned that arrow functions negate "this" use in function declaration
- figured out new objects have to be instantiated *after* the object prototype methods are defined

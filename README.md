# A bookshelf

##### TO-DO NEXT

##### TO-DO LATER
- add .read and .notRead classes to style differently somehow
- handle long titles/authors
- start with x(3?) shelves then add more as needed
- sort them different ways
- add genres?

###### DONE
- make book card width correspond to page count
- learned that arrow functions negate "this" use in function declaration
- figured out new objects have to be instantiated *after* the object prototype methods are defined
